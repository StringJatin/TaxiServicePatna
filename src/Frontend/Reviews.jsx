                <p>The quality of a good business is how they treat their customers when costumer need your service. I
                    booked an airport pickup for a family vacation online and called a few minutes before the scheduled
                    time to confirm the pickup and they said they were on their way. When the arranged time came and
                    went we started to panic. I called and was told the driver got his vehicles tire flat; however, they
                    had another driver dispatched.They arrived within 15 mins of my call and even upgraded our transport
                    at no extra cost. Will recommend www.torontotaxilimo.ca</p>
